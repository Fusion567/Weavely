# ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange
---
## 🧵 Overview

**Weavely** is a web-based platform designed to promote sustainable fashion by enabling users to exchange unused clothing. Users can either **swap directly** with others or use a **point-based redemption system** to claim listed items. The platform aims to reduce textile waste and encourage the reuse of wearable garments instead of discarding them.
